# christmascountdown_it
 A simple line-commad application written to show how to use Calendar, Date, SimpleDateFormato classes in Java to create a countdown with a specific date. 
 Also in the application was added a clip sound to show how to use the AudioInputStream class.  
 Note: In the code i didn't use the classic File class but i used a URL class which capture the clip audio in the sound folder  (flagged in the Eclipse IDE as resource folder) and exported inside the jar file.
